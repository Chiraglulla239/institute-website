            Mechanics is the area of physics concerned with the motions of macroscopic objects.
            It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with
            the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.
            The field is today less widely understood in terms of quantum theory.

            No single discovery has affected our lives, our culture and our survival more than electricity.
            Electricity is everywhere; it lights our way, cooks our food and can even brush your teeth. For
            an example, imagine where the medical field would be without electricity and in that sense how 
            many lives have been saved due to electrical devices like defibrillators, pacemakers, etc.  
            From talkies to eight tracks to screaming “I want my MTV”, even hashtagging, none of it would be 
            possible #WithoutElectricity. Read on to discover more about basic electrical theory..
