                Teaching Engineering has always been more of experience to me than a profession.
                Subjects like Engineering Mechanics and Engineering Graphics, which are usually 
                considered to be most difficult, come naturally to me. On the top of that, when
                a student can relate most of the subjects with the things that they actually use
                in real world, that feeling itself is exemplary. <br>
                Professional Education is still in nascent stage in India, where most subjects are
                taught in theoretical manner. I wish to change that in a drastic way, where a class
                should be considered as a place for students' ideas and not some place where concepts
                are bombarded upon students for getting good marks in Exams.

            No single discovery has affected our lives, our culture and our survival more than electricity.
            Electricity is everywhere; it lights our way, cooks our food and can even brush your teeth. For
            an example, imagine where the medical field would be without electricity and in that sense how 
            many lives have been saved due to electrical devices like defibrillators, pacemakers, etc.  
            From talkies to eight tracks to screaming “I want my MTV”, even hashtagging, none of it would be 
            possible #WithoutElectricity. Read on to discover more about basic electrical theory..
