                    Teaching Engineering has always been more of experience to me than a profession.
                    Subjects like Engineering Mechanics and Engineering Graphics, which are usually 
                    considered to be most difficult, come naturally to me. On the top of that, when
                    a student can relate most of the subjects with the things that they actually use
                    in real world, that feeling itself is exemplary. <br>
                    Professional Education is still in nascent stage in India, where most subjects are
                    taught in theoretical manner. I wish to change that in a drastic way, where a class
                    should be considered as a place for students' ideas and not some place where concepts
                    are bombarded upon students for getting good marks in Exams.
