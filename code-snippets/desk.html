                    <i>Teaching Engineering has always been more of experience to me than a profession.
                    Subjects like Engineering Mechanics and Engineering Graphics, which are usually 
                    considered to be most difficult, come naturally to me. On the top of that, when
                    a student can relate most of the subjects with the things that they actually use
                    in real world, that feeling itself is exemplary. <br>
                    Professional Education is still in nascent stage in India, where most subjects are
                    taught in theoretical manner. I wish to change that in a drastic way, where a class
                    should be considered as a place for students' ideas and not some place where concepts
                    are bombarded upon students for getting good marks in Exams.</i>

               <i>Being a Professor there has always been a great pleasure for me to
               convey my Knowledge about the subject to you, Basic Electrical
               Engineering. Making this subject enjoyable and most importantly making you
               visualize the concepts which help in understanding the concepts better.
               Assuring you that we will have a great journey together. <br>
               And the best part of this journey is that you will never be
               alone, even at the silliest of points, even after you complete your
               formal Engineering. Maybe I will just be a teacher for the subject but,
               I will be a mentor for anything else. My students are indeed my responsibility!</i>
